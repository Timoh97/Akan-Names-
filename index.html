            <p>Luckily for us,<br>
             there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date. </p>

            Let's make it fun! Enter your date of birth and we shall give you Akan name. <br>
            Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. <br> Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name'<br>
             which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
